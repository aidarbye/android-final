# HaHaHub

## Project Overview
HaHaHub is an Android application designed to entertain users by offering a variety of jokes, a random joke generator, and suggestions for activities to try when bored. The app integrates with the Official Joke API and the Bored API to provide an engaging user experience.

The architecture will consist of Activation transitions, internal navigation between fragments using navigation-fragment-ktx, navigation-ui-ktx, network work will take place using retrofit. The UI will be divided into activities and fragments, ViewModels will be used for business logic, and data will be stored in models. Firebase will be used for authorization and further work with the user.Callback and koroutines will be used to work with asynchrony
